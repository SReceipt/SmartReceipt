Smart Receipt
Empower Sustainability Through Blockchain

# Smart Receipt - 5ire x ADU Hackathon Project

This project was created as part of the 5ire x ADU Hackathon, an event aimed at bringing together developers and innovators to explore new ideas and create exciting new projects. 

Following the UAEâ€™s sustainability plan and initiative to go paperless. According to the Dubai government going paperless has already saved in expenses and is a great factor in achieving sustainability. As there have been over 20,000 trees saved, 14 government entities have stated that the use of paper sheets has decreased from 261 million sheets to 169 million sheets per year. 7.7 million hours of labor have been saved. The reduction of the use of paper has led to savings up to 725 million dirhams up to date. 

Our team focused on the problem of managing paper receipts, which can be difficult to track and organize, and can contribute to waste and environmental damage. We proposed a solution that leverages blockchain technology to store all receipts in one digital wallet, making it easier to search and manage receipts over time. 


## Project Overview

Sustainable options have a significant impact on a global scale, resulting in the conservation of 1 billion gallons of water, the preservation of 10 million trees, the conservation of 250 million gallons of oil, and the reduction of 1.5 billion pounds of waste.

Our project, Smart Receipt, is a blockchain-based solution that allows users to store all their receipts in a single digital wallet. By leveraging the security and immutability of blockchain technology, we ensure that receipts are tamper-proof and can be accessed by users whenever they need them. 

In addition, Smart Receipt includes powerful search and filter capabilities that make it easy for users to find specific receipts, even years after they were originally issued. Users can search by vendor, date, amount, or any other relevant criteria, ensuring that they can find the receipts they need quickly and easily.

Finally, Smart Receipt also includes features to ensure that insurance claims cannot be denied by vendors. By storing all receipts in a single, secure location, we eliminate the possibility of lost or missing receipts, which can be a common reason for insurance claim denial.


## Program Parties

Our program will be used by two parties, the user (customer) and the vendor (shop). It will check for the payment method used (cash, card, or crypto) and store this information on a crypto wallet on the blockchain. The receipts will contain all the necessary information, including VAT, date and time, and items purchased.


## Contributors

This project was developed by a team of talented and dedicated developers, including:

- Youssef Salem Al Hamadi
- Kamel Ahmed Qassem 
- Mohammad Omer Kidwai
- Mohammed Nofal



We'd like to extend our thanks to the organizers of the 5ire x ADU Hackathon for providing us with this opportunity, and to our fellow participants for inspiring us with their creativity and innovation. We look forward to continuing to develop and refine Smart Receipt, and to sharing our findings with the wider developer and environmental communities.

## Note

As we have tried to contact the technical team regarding integrating our application with 5ire blockchain but they didn't respond, so as a team, we have currently decided to keep our project blueprint written in Java, given our current knowledge and expertise. However, it is important to note that the project is still incomplete and not functional at this stage. We are continuously exploring and evaluating different options and technologies to improve and enhance the project's functionality and efficiency..
